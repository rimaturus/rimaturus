# Hi there 👋

## About Me

I'm a dedicated and enthusiastic Master's degree student pursuing a degree in Robotics Engineering, with a strong passion for robotics, autonomous driving, and cutting-edge technology.

**Fun fact:** My GitHub username "rimaturus" is derived from the Latin word "rimor" meaning "to explore/discover." I chose this verb in the future participle form to reflect my ongoing passion and commitment for delving into new technologies and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in robotics.
